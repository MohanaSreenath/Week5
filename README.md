### Next Steps

### Overview
Week 5 is dedicated to advanced file input/output (IO) operations, working with CSV files, and manipulating JSON data in Java. These skills are vital for building applications that interact with external data sources, perform data analysis, or integrate with other systems.

### Topics Covered
Day 1: IO Programming with CSV Files

Reading and writing CSV files

Parsing CSV data into Java objects

Filtering, sorting, and searching CSV records

Merging and modifying CSV files

Detecting duplicates and validating data

Encrypting/decrypting CSV content

Converting between CSV and JSON formats

Real-world examples: Employee and student data management, large file processing, exporting database results to CSV

Day 2: JSON Processing in Java

Introduction to JSON structure and syntax

Parsing JSON data in Java

Manipulating and generating JSON objects

Practical exercises: Censoring sensitive data, IPL data analysis, hands-on JSON practice

### Prerequisites
Completion of Week 4 (Advanced Java: Generics, Collections, IO, Regex, JUnit, Java 8)

Java Development Kit (JDK) installed

Familiarity with Java IO streams and basic data structures

### How to Use This Repository
The Week5 folder is organized by day and topic, each containing Java source files and relevant data files (e.g., CSV, JSON).

Explore, run, and modify the code to understand file reading/writing, data transformation, and integration techniques.

Practice by implementing additional features, such as custom data validation or format conversion, to reinforce your learning.
